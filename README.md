# Project-Dancing-Badgers-CS300-
This project was a part of UW Madison’s Comp Sci 300 course taught in Spring 2023. It involves developing a graphical application to simulate badgers dance show on a basketball arena. It allows the user to add or remove a number of badgers to the display window (by pressing the keys ‘b’ and ‘r’ when pointed at the object respectively).
Users can move the badger objects arbitrary within the display window using the mouse. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) application is written using a PApplet object and PImage objects defined within the processing library. It also has interactive objects Starship Robots that will be delivering food in the area surrounding the basketball court. The Badgers can dance (by pressing the key ‘d’) and basketballs will rotate when clicked on. Finally by pressing the key ‘c’ the court will get cleared.
